### **Result**

Thus the current series  feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | =5hz | =3.5hz|
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | =1.5Mhz | =550khz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = \1.495Mhz) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = \546.5khz) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = \26.52) | \( A'{v(mid)} = \21.12) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point |  18.75| 7.86 |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
